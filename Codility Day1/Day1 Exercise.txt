See few Array related solved functions


Assignments  

1) Write a program that will find the number of odd and even numbers between 2 given numbers(In a range)

2) write a programm that will count the factorials present in a given range 1 1,2,6,24

3) Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array (assume all elements are distinct)	

4) Write a program in C# Sharp to separate odd and even integers in separate arrays. 

Test Data :
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :5
Input 5 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 25
element - 1 : 47
element - 2 : 42
element - 3 : 56
element - 4 : 32
Expected Output:
The Even elements are:
42 56 32
The Odd elements are :
25 47
