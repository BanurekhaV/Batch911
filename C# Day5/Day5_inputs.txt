Polymorphism
Static Binding/Early Binding/Compiletime Binding : All function calls resolved at compile time (using overload)

Dynaic/Late/Runtime binding : All function calls resolved at Runtime (using Override)

Constant Variable : 
-One which has to be declared with the constant keyword
-It has to be assigned a value while declaring
- eg: const float PI=3.14f;
-You cannot change the value afterwards

Readonly:
- Has to be declared with a keyword readonly
- can assign values while declaring or in the constructor, no where else.
-eg : class test {

readonly int myvar;

public test()
{
myvar=5;}
}
-After initialization, you cannot change the value



Exception :

User defined exception classes should always inherit from ApplicationException base class

Indexers :
Smart Array or Array of Objects

int[]arr={2,4,5,6,7};

-Indexers are like properties but do not have names like properties
-indexers can be overloaded
-they are represented using the 'this' keyword
