1. Create a class called Course with(id, name,duration,fees) and relevant constructors

create another class called Info. Write a method called as:
	public void display(Course c) {
		//Code here to display the details of given Course
	}

Create App class with main method. Then

  - Write a method called as scenario1 to:
	- Create few objects of Course class
	- Call the display method of Info class

  - Write a method called as scenario2 to:
	- Create array of Course class and store few objects in it
	- Now iterate over the array and call the display method for each student

  - Write a method called as scenario3 to:
	- Take Course data as input from the user, store it in Course object
	- Repeat the above process using loops
	- Use Arrays to store the Course objects as covered in scenario2
	- Finally iterate over the array to display all the collected data

Organize the code using namespaces (for ex: com.lti.casestudy.day1)
