Case Study Day 4 Plan

- We had created an AppEngine class before to store data in memory.
- All we need to do now is to modify that code and introduce database connectivity.

For ex: the code for register method might look like this 

    public void register(Student student) {
		SqlConnection conn = null;
		SqlCommand cmd = null;
		try {
			con=new SqlConnection("Data Source=  ; Initial Catalog=;Integrated Security=true");
			//Take inputs from the user
			cmd= new SqlCommand("insert into student values(@,@,@)",con);
			//Add parameters
			
			//Execute
		}
		catch(Exception e) {
			Console.Write(); //instead throw user defined exception
		}
		finally {
			
		}
    }
